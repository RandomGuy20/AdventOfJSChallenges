# Day 23 - Toaster

# Brief
- In this project, we're creating a Toaster


## Challenge


Users should be able to:


-    When the page first loads, the toaster should be hidden. (Add a class of `collapsed` to the `<div class="toaster">` on line 15.)
-    If the user moves their mouse toward the top of the page (exit intent) display the pop-up. (Remove the `collapsed` class on line 15.)
-    If the user has been on the site for more than 15 seconds, display the pop-up.
-    Clicking on the close button, makes the toaster disappear.
