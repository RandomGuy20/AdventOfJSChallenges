# Day 19 - Form Validator

# Brief
- In this project, we're creating a Form Validator.


## Challenge


Users should be able to:


 - When the user unfocuses a field, the form should perform a validation check
 - All the fields are required
 - Should enter a properly formatted email address
 - The password and confirm password fields should match
 - Clicking on the show / hide button on the password field should change the visibility of the password (simply change the input `type` from `password` to `text` or vice versa)
